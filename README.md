A comprehensive project documentation template providing standardized structure and best practices for enterprise-level projects. Covers the complete project lifecycle from overview to operations.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **AI-Friendly**: Structured template design for easy AI understanding and content generation
- 📚 **Standardized Structure**: Unified project documentation organization framework
- 🏢 **Enterprise-Grade**: Documentation standards designed for enterprise projects
- 📋 **Lifecycle Coverage**: Complete documentation system from project initiation to operations
- 🔗 **Traceability**: Clear inter-document relationships with automated validation support

## 📖 Usage Guide

### About the `docs/` Folder

All files under `docs/` are **sample documents** for reference. Copy them into your project and adapt the content. File names use plain `.md` extension (no `.template` or `.sample` suffix).

### For AI Usage

This template is optimized for AI-assisted development. AI should read:

- **llms.txt** - Complete usage guide, conventions, and workflows
- **AGENTS.md** - AI agent configuration, capability definitions, and collaboration standards
- **docs/specs/documentation-spec.md** - Canonical governance spec for naming, references, and validation

**AI Quick Start**:

1. Read `llms.txt` for complete usage instructions
2. Select appropriate documents from `docs/` based on project type
3. Copy samples and adapt content for your project
4. Maintain table formatting and document relationships

### For Human Usage

Select documentation sets based on project scale:
