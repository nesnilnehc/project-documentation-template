# Project Documentation Template

> Standardized documentation templates for enterprise projects, optimized for AI-assisted development.

## Overview

This repository provides sample documentation covering the entire software development lifecycle. All files under `docs/` are reference samples—copy them into your project and adapt the content. No `.template` or `.sample` suffix is used; filenames are plain `.md`.

## Quick Start for AI

### 1. Understanding Project Structure

Read `README.md` to understand the complete documentation hierarchy. The structure follows enterprise project lifecycle:
- Project Overview (goals, vision, version history)
- Requirements & Planning (requirements documentation and management)
- Architecture & Design (system, application, data architecture, and design deliverables)
- Development Guide (standards, build/test, release management)
- Process Management (agile workflow, change management, governance)
- Operations Guide (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting)
- User Guide (getting started, features, troubleshooting)
- Compliance & Community (legal, privacy, support)

### 2. Sample Document Usage

Documents in `docs/` are samples with:
- Structured placeholders: `[description]`, `[option1/option2]` where content should be customized
- Tables with variable rows
- Field explanations in comments
- AI filling guidelines where applicable

### 3. Common Workflows

**Initialize Project Documentation**:
1. Identify project type and scale (small/medium/large)
2. Select appropriate documents from README structure
3. Copy samples from `docs/` into your project
4. Adapt placeholders and content for your project
5. Maintain cross-document references

**Generate Architecture Decision Record**:
1. Use `docs/process-management/decisions/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Generate sequential ADR number (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
3. Fill decision context, options, rationale, and consequences
4. Update decision index

**Update Version Information**:
1. Locate `VERSION` file (semantic version)
2. Update version following `docs/development-guide/release-management/versioning-standards.md`
3. Update related documents referencing the version
4. Update version history tables in affected documents

## Key Documents

### Core Documents

- `docs/project-overview/goals-and-vision.md` - Project goals and vision
- `docs/process-management/decisions/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` - Architecture decision records (copy to create new ADRs)
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture/technology-stack/dependency-management/dependency-management-strategy.md` - Dependency management

### Standard Documents

- `docs/development-guide/development-standards/configuration-management/environment-variable-management-strategy.md` - Environment variable management
- `docs/development-guide/release-management/versioning-standards.md` - Semantic versioning standards
- `docs/development-guide/release-management/release-quality-gate.md` - Release quality gates
- `docs/requirements-planning/requirements-management/requirements-priority-management.md` - Requirements prioritization frameworks
- `docs/process-management/decisions/samples/20251010-process-management-strategy.md` - Process management strategy (Git + Platform hybrid example)
- `docs/process-management/project-board/backlog.md` - Backlog format reference

## Document Conventions

### Placeholder Format

- `[description]` - Text content to fill
- `[option1/option2]` - Enumeration values to choose from
- `YYYY-MM-DD` - Date format
- `[number]` - Numeric values

### Table Processing

- Keep column alignment in Markdown format
- Add/remove rows based on actual needs
- Fields marked with `*` are required
- Optional fields can be left empty or removed

### Version Management

When modifying documents:
1. Update version history table at document bottom
2. Record change description
3. Update date and author information

## Document Relationships

### Reference Formats

- File reference: `<mcfile name="filename" path="relative/path"></mcfile>`
- External reference: `<mcreference link="URL" index="number">number</mcreference>`
- Internal link: `[Document Name](relative/path)`

### Key Relationships

- Roadmap milestones ↔ Version management versions
- Requirements documents ↔ Project board tasks
- Architecture decisions ↔ Technology selection documents

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing generated documents:

- [ ] All placeholders `[...]` replaced
- [ ] Table formatting intact, no misalignment
- [ ] Date format consistent (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Version history updated
- [ ] Cross-document references valid
- [ ] Markdown syntax correct
- [ ] Chinese-English mixed formatting proper

## Special Markers

### AI Filling Guidelines

Sections marked with "**AI 填充指南**" or "**AI Filling Guide**" contain instructions for AI. These can be removed after filling is complete.

### Optional Content

Sections marked with "可选" or "Optional" can be kept or removed based on project complexity.

### Task Lists

- `- [ ]` Incomplete tasks
- `- [x]` Completed tasks

## Best Practices

### Progressive Filling

1. Fill required fields first
2. Confirm key information with user
3. Fill optional fields
4. Optimize formatting and details

### Consistency Maintenance

- Keep project name consistent across all documents
- Unify date formats
- Standardize terminology
- Follow semantic versioning for version numbers

### Intelligent Inference

AI can infer from context:
- Project type → Select appropriate templates
- Tech stack → Fill dependency management strategy
- Team size → Adjust process complexity

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| Unreplaced placeholders | Prompt user for missing information |
| Table format errors | Auto-fix alignment issues |
| Inconsistent date formats | Convert to YYYY-MM-DD |
| Broken links | Check and fix relative paths |
| Version conflicts | Prompt user to confirm correct version |

## Integration

### Git Operations

```bash
# Suggested Git operations
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: initialize project documentation"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
```

### CI/CD Validation

Generate validation scripts for:
- Markdown format checking
- Link validity verification
- Placeholder detection
- Version number consistency check
